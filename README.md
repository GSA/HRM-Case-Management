# HRM Case Management

_This project has been archived, no further updates are planned at this time._

## About

Provides Chief People Officer (HR) with a tool to track various cases that are received from general users and the Inspector General. It is also meant to help streamline and make consistent the process for handling administrative referrals (violations of personnel policies or practices) and misconduct referrals (which involve acts of behavior, ethics, misuse or negligence).

HR Employees can receive complaints or investigations through a number of channels including phone and paper forms. Employees can easily create a new HR case through the HRM Case Management application. To do so, they simply select the case type upon creation.

Once the case is created, they are able to fill out all relevant information (depending on the type of case). They can easily assign the case to the proper HR representative, as well as its priority and update its status as necessary

Once a specialist has followed up with the case, they are able to edit the relevant information and eventually update the caseâ€™s status to closed. During this process they can upload and relevant documentation; including meeting notes, reports etc. directly to the case so that it is all contained in one place for future reference.

Because of this implementation, HR is now able to easily manage, report on, and follow up with cases that have been submitted to them and are no longer hindered by spreadsheets. If you have any additional questions about the HRM Case Management Application, please reach out gsalabs@gsa.gov.
